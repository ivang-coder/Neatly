# Neatly-Compressed Readme
Neatly-Compressed is a Shell-written FFMpeg-based media file compressor.

## Intro
What if your NAS/JBOD has a pile of videos made with a variety of cameras where the files are inefficiently compressed resulting in bloated file size.

Your collection of video files might be spread across a tiered folder structure mixed with raw video as well as efficiently compressed (hevc, heic) and inefficiently compressed (x264) video.

Neatly might be a solution you're looking for. The suite is designed to be executed in manual as well as automated way.

- Neatly-Compressed being a CPU-intensive module (due to the nature of FFMpeg) is designed to be executed primarily on systems with high-performance CPUs, i.e. Intel Core i3/i5/i7/i9, AMD Athlon/Opteron, etc. The project can also run on devices with low-performance CPUs, i.e. Intel Pentium/Celeron-based NAS systems and old PCs. Expect a lot longer encoding time on systems with low-performance CPUs, especially when x265 mode is selected.
